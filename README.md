# passpolicy.py
A short python script for wordlists to filter out passwords not containing 1 of each character.

# USAGE
Simply edit the file to reflect the password file you want to filter out. It will clear everything that doesn't match the policy. You can also set the length that you want. By default the password policy is one of each character (upper, lower, number, special character) and at least 8 characters.
